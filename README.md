#### The Game
The game in which groups of friends and family, no matter how near or far, draw on a shared canvas to win the judges' favor. Picture Imperfect is a web-based game in which you and your friends recieve a word to draw so that the judge can guess it. The only caveat is that you are drawing ona canvas on which your opponents are also drawing. The goal is to get the round's judge(s) to guess your word first. So, how do you play exactly?
